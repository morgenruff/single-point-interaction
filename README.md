## Project Overview
- Use P5.JS, and an LLM of your choosing to create a single-point user input interaction that generates/modifies and exports graphic elements.
- The graphic elements can be anything from a generative pattern system, an auto-collage maker, typographic experiments, particle systems, shape and color generators, text/story or prompt generators, etc.

## Deliverables
- Total graphic elements should be a total of 16 outputs (images or moving images, audio files, text strings, stories, etc.) that are cohesive, and created by a collaboration between you, the designer, and your Expert System.
- Full documentation of your process, including images or text samples showing how you trained your Expert System.
- One final PDF, Keynote, Figma, or Google Slides links presentation showing your process and finals.

## Goals
- Refresh your knowledge of P5.JS.
- Use LLMs (Chat GPT) to begin training an Expert System for your project. This expert system will help debug, explain why code works and how, and will become better and more responsive as you shape its design.
- Collect your outputs as iterations and save them into one final presentation file, with links to the working program(s).
- Collect the training process you did with your Expert System.
